# VibeOS: A Self-Hosted Platform for AI-Driven Development

**VibeOS** is a self-hosted platform purpose-built for *vibe coding* ‚Äî a new paradigm in software development where natural language meets powerful AI-driven code generation. Forked from the popular [CasaOS](https://www.casaos.io/), VibeOS transforms the home server OS into an intelligent, developer-friendly environment tailored to both professionals and enthusiasts who want to build, test, and deploy software using AI.

---

## üåü What is VibeOS?

VibeOS reimagines CasaOS as a containerized, AI-powered operating system for developers. Instead of writing code manually, users describe their software requirements in natural language and receive complete code implementations through integrated large language models.

Whether you're a seasoned developer or a beginner exploring the world of code, VibeOS bridges the gap between intention and execution by empowering you to focus on problem-solving, not syntax.

---

## üîó The Convergence of Two Powerful Concepts

VibeOS brings together:

- **CasaOS**: A modern, open-source personal cloud system built on Docker. It‚Äôs lightweight, intuitive, and user-friendly ‚Äî perfect for managing home server applications.
- **Vibe Coding**: Introduced by Andrej Karpathy in 2025, vibe coding enables developers to use AI models to generate code from natural language, transforming the developer‚Äôs role into that of a curator and refiner of AI-generated output.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Features & Architecture

### üß± Containerized AI Development Environment

VibeOS builds on CasaOS's Docker-centric foundation and introduces containers for:

- **AI Model Integration**  
  Pre-configured containers running coding-optimized large language models (LLMs), similar to CasaOS's bundled LLaMA3 support.

- **Development Workspaces**  
  Fully-featured, browser-accessible cloud IDEs (e.g., Theia, Coder) tailored for vibe coding workflows.

- **Testing & Debugging Tools**  
  Containers offering static analysis, sandbox execution, and runtime debugging for AI-generated code.

---

### üß† Natural Language Programming Interface

Enhancing CasaOS‚Äôs intuitive UI, VibeOS introduces:

- **Prompt Engineering Interface**  
  Tools for crafting, saving, and refining natural language prompts for code generation.

- **Code Generation Dashboard**  
  Real-time visualization of AI-generated code with syntax highlighting, logs, and diff views.

- **Interactive Refinement Tools**  
  AI-guided interfaces to revise, extend, or correct generated code through conversation-like feedback.

---

### üîã Resource Optimization

AI workloads are resource-intensive. VibeOS includes:

- **Adaptive Resource Allocation**  
  Smart orchestration of CPU/GPU resources for optimal model performance.

- **Model Selection & Routing**  
  Switch between self-hosted lightweight models and remote APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic) as needed.

- **GPU Acceleration**  
  Supports NVIDIA and AMD GPU passthrough for LLM inference acceleration.
